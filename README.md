# rl_embedded_os
experiments embedding reinforcement learning in operating systems. agents are designed to be run one at a time in this repository for isolated experimentation.

Run setup.sh to setup the virtual machine and launch_vm.sh to launch it. Run 'sudo shutdown now' in the command line after logging in to shut it down once you're done.

Look at the README in rl_file_agent to run the rl_file_agent.
